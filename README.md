# Comm 220 Lab 4
Here, you will find Labs #1-3 from our Comm 220 Methods course!

The code found in here is from several lab assignments. 

##### Lab Descriptions

Lab #1: The primary goal of this lab was to familizarize ourselves with R. Utilizing a pre-exisitng dataset, we were asked to explore the difference in average title length between two different news sources. 

Lab #2: Building on Lab #1, we dabbled in introductory natural langauge processing (NLP) analyses for this assignment. We were asked to select a measurement (i.e., character type, word length, etc.), run a t-test, and report relevant results. 

Lab #3: This week focused on computational modeling. The goal of the lab was to explore some basics of agent-based modeling in R. We were given a couple files (one containing functions, the other a main script) to load into R. We were able to edit the main script for the model (i.e., change number of agents, change number of interactions, etc.) and see how various changes play out when we run the model.
